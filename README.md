The University  is extending its network services and they have asked you 
to design and implement their network which consist of two subnets, each subnet has 
10 mobile nodes connected to a mobile edge server, a communication is limited 
within the subnet and the topology used in each subnet is a mesh topology, all the 
nodes within the network are connected to the centralised Domain name server 
(DNS). Introduce an attack node to perform a distributed denial of service (DDoS) / 
man-in-the-middle (MITM) (specifically ARP spoofing) attack on the network. To 
detect this attack, network traffic data is collected from all nodes, and you can define 
features such as packet count, inter-arrival time, payload size, payload entropy, and 
mismatch count and so on. To differentiate between normal traffic and attack traffic 
use an intrusion detection system, all detected traffic should be stored in its separate 
file for further analysis. 


**
This is just the layout design and mock man-in-the-middle attack, not an actual event using virtual machines..etc**
